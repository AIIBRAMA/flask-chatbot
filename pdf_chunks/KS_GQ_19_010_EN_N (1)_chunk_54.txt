nsmission is prepared and sent to the compil er 
for comments.  
This report contains the outcomes of the following verifications.  
Completeness  and coding  
Completeness of the data is verified both against previous transmissions (newly missing amounts, 
either not provided or coded as "L" – not available)  and against the compulsory observations to be 
provided.  
Basic consistency checks  
Aggregate consistency checks verify the following accounting identities  across all subsectors and 
COFOG groups : 
TE = D.1 + D.3 + D.4 + D.6M + P.2 + (D.29 + D.5 +D.8) + D.7 +  D.9 + OP5ANP  
OP5ANP = P.5 + NP  
OEC = OED + P.2  
P.3 = P.31 + P.32  
D.6M = D.62 + D.632  
Additionally, the following two inequalities are verified:  
D.9 ≥ D.92  
P.31 ≥ D.632  
Sector consistency and consolidation verification check the following:  
For any transac tion except D.4, D.7, D.9 and TE and any COFOG detail  
S.13 = S.1311 + S.1312 + S.1313 + S.1314.  
For D.4, D.7, D.9 and TE and any COFOG detail
