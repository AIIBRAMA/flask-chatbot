nomic Policy Committee produced a document on 22 May 2006 ("Statistical needs of the 
EPC") stating its statistical needs. Section 3 is devoted in particular to COFOG 2nd level data. The 
main requirements included in this document refer to the availability of data for individual expenditure 
items with a sufficient level of detail, in particular by facilitating the release of data for further 
countries, extending available tim e-series, improving timeliness, and making further progress on the 
methodological framework on the basis of the questionnaires on country practices and best 
practices. Detailed breakdowns were important for some functions: environmental protection ( 05), 
health care ( 07), education ( 09) and social protection (10). In addition to that some individual second 
level items, such as R&D, basic research, transport and communication would also be of utmost 
importance, jointly with an appropriate timely and long time  series data release for all COFOG 
functions.
