Manual on COFOG statistics  
Where ever  intraflows on D.4, D.7 and D.9 are provided, the following is  additionally verified  for all 
COFOG breakdowns : 
S.13 = (S.1311 + S.1312 + S.1313 + S1314) - flows between subsectors.  
COFOG consistency  
This check verifies that "TOTAL" equals the sum of divisions and that divisions equal the sum of their 
groups for all t ransactions, S.13 and all subsectors.  
In all of the above verifications, a coding of the data as "L" – missing - prevents the calculation of the 
check if more than one "L" is provided for the breakdown. If an "L" is provided for an aggregate, the 
test is n ot performed if at least one breakdown is also coded "L". Otherwise the test is performed and 
the observation coded "L" is indicated as potentially containing a false coding.  
A coding of "M" will for all practical purposes be treated in the same way as a numerical zero.
