sectors’ expenditure is greater than general government expenditure because of the different 
treatment of D.4, D.7 and D.9 transactions between the subsector s. For ex ample, grants paid by 
central government to local government would be shown as the expenditure of central government in 
the subsector  analysis but would not be part of the expenditure of general government. As the 
consolidation principle holds, such grants  are eliminated at general government level as they 
represent at the same time expenditure of central government and revenue of local government.  
In subsector tables, grants paid by one part of government to another are classified according to the 
specific  function the grants are related to and the function of the payer’s expenditure will be the same 
of the function of the recipient’s expenditure. However in case the grants are given to finance the 
general activity of the receiving unit, who can then decide  how to use the grants according to its own
