tion expenditure of general government are the 
main part of the COFOG divisions 07 health, 09 education, and 10 social protection, excluding only 
the groups related to R&D and oth er expenditure not elsewhere classified  (n.e.c.) but including social 
exclusion n.e.c . As far as COFOG division  08 recreation, culture and religion is concerned, the  
groups corresponding to general government individual consumption expenditure are the firs t two: 
08.1 recreational and sporting services and 08.2 cultural services.  
COFOG and Coicop thus have a consistent definition of individual consumption expenditure of 
general government.  
In the ESA 2010 transmission programme, Coicop compilation is forese en within ESA table 5, but 
only for divisions 01 -12 concerning households. Therefore a data comparison is only possible at 
national level, wherever the two classifications are simultaneously used for general government.
