od underlined the need of:  
a) controlling the sustainability of public finances by reducing government debt ratios and 
reforming pension and health care systems to verify the consistent allocation of public 
resources in line with the strategic  objective of improving long -term growth;  
b) assessing the governmentsâ€™ fulfilments of their functions to verify if public resources were 
used in the most efficient and effective way. To this aim, the link of input data on public 
expenditure to outputs and po licy outcomes - that correspond to money spent on different 
functions (e.g. comparing expenditure on education, health care or R&D with results 
achieved in terms of policy objectives) - is very relevant.
