Unlike ESA95, and following on from the developments in 2008 SNA, ESA 2010 contains a specific 
chapter (ch apter 22) on satellite accounts.  
Health accounts are discussed in ESA 2010 para. 22. 79-22.88. 
ESA 2010 para. 22.83 explains that the production boundary of SHA is expanded in two cases

ancillary  service (if financed by employers) and second for cash transfers to households for home 
care for the sick and disabled.  
For general government and COFOG the second would have an impact on the comparability of the

back sources of financing of health care. This approach of taking into account intra -governmental 
transfers, tax deductions, subsidies
