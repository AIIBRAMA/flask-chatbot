
Guidance: 03.1, 03.2, 07.3 where possible.  
In Europe, a single European emergency number (112) has been establi shed, through which police, 
fire brigade, ambulances, rescue services and coast guards can be reached.  
Expenditure on operating single emergency number is multi -purpose.  
COFOG group 03.2 'fire protection services' contains – apart from fire protection, al so other civil 
protection services such as mountain rescue  and beach surveillance.  
Police services (and coast guards) are classified in group 03.1.  
In the description of division 07 health , no mention is made of the operation of ambulance services. 
Howeve r, case 25 on transfers to domestic emergency medical services mentions that ambulance 
services should be included in this group, whenever not delivered by hospitals (07.3).  
Conceptually, the expenditure related to single emergency numbers should be split across the 
impacted COFOG groups, such as health groups and 03.1, 03.2, etc.
