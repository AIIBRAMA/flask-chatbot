rces. Suppliers meet their 
obligations by presenting certificates to the regulator . Where suppliers do not have sufficient 
certificates  to cover their obli gation, a payme nt is made into a  buyout fund. The proceeds of the 
buyout fund are paid back to suppliers in proportion to how many certificates  they have presented.  
Amounts for the certificates are shown in the National Accounts as both a tax received by 
government and a s a subsidy paid by government. More specifically, the certificates  are recorded as 
a tax received on products excluding VAT and import taxes (D.214) and as a subsidy on products 
paid by government (D.31).  
The intention of the scheme is not to subsidies th e energy providers but rather to regulate the energy 
sector with a view to protecting the environment. Environ mental protection is the main purpose of the 
scheme. For this reason, pollution abatement (05.3) is the most appropriate group for the 
expenditure  component.
