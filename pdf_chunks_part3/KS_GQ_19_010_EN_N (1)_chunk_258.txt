COFOG and CEPA  
CEPA is used to classify activities, products, expenditure and other transactions whose primary 
purpose is environmental protection. Consequently, its scope overlaps with the scope of CO FOG 
division 05 ‘environmental protection’. In general, all EP activities and expenditure classified 
according to CEPA can be classified only within COFOG division 05. In turn, COFOG division 05 
includes exclusively EP activities and expenditure that is cl assified within CEPA.  
There is a nearly one -to-one correspondence between this COFOG division and I level breakdown of 
CEPA (see table 7). With its nine main environmental domains (I level), broken down into up to eight 
sub-categories (some of which are sp lit even further), CEPA provides a much more detailed structure 
of environmental protection purposes than COFOG.
