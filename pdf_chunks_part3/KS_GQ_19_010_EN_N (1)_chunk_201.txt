rm (phasing out) of an early 
retirement pension scheme  
Guidance: General public services n.e.c.  (01.6) 
An early retirement pension scheme, which had the purpose of social protection and prev ention of 
youth unemployment was phased out. The contributors to the scheme were refunded (D.99 other 
capital transfer ).  
The open question was whether to record the capital transfer to the initial contributors (refunding) 
according to the original purpose  of the scheme (COFOG groups 10.2 and 10.5, which was not 
fulfilled) and consider this as a reimbursement for a ‘missed right' to an early pension, or to record 
this as general, miscellaneous expenditure under COFOG group 01.6.  
The COFOG TF considered that  the refunding of the contributions has no social protection purpose, 
in contrast to the original purpose of the scheme. Thus, the capital transfers to households should be 
allocated to COFOG group 01.6.
