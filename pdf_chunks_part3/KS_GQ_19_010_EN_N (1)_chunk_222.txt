 of government, where one unit is responsible for 
providing  a service/ good and the other unit is obliged to fund it. In such cases, the size of 
the payment may be determined ex ante;  
ï‚· (possibly) the government unit making the payment is responsible for the provision of the 
good or service (to households or as part  of actual final consumption of government) and 
can choose to do so in a number of ways: own -account production, purchase from a market 
producer or delegation to another non -market unit in government.  
However, where payments for a service or good are depe ndent on the volume of output produced 
and these services or goods could equally be purchased from market producers, there is an 
indication that the payments should be classified as sales. Examples are purchases by general 
government units that are classif ied as social transfers in kind/ intermediate consumption e.g. 
treatment -based payments in public hospitals or volume -related price reductions accordin
