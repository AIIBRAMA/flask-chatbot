ect, general government should still record P.31 individual 
consumption expenditure.  
The P.31, however is now constituted of D.631 social transfers in kind provided by general 
government units.  
The question is in wh ich unit/ entity should be showing the P.31 , and whether the recordi ng should 
be accompanied by recording of a sale of service between the two units involved or not ? 
This case was discussed in both the GFS TF and the COFOG TF in several meetings. A final 
proposal was presented to the EDPS WG.  
It helped in raising and resolving two general issues  
 under which conditions should grants within general government be recorded , and under 
which conditions should sales of service be recorded?  
 as a subset of the first  issue, but posing additional recording difficulties: How can the 
provision of a social transfer in kind by one government unit where another government unit 
is responsible for the specific task be best recorded?
