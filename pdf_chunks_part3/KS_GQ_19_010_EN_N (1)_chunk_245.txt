Apart from the three mandatory monetary environmental accounts datasets, Eurostat collects on a 
regular basis data on environmental subsidies and simi lar transfers (ESST), and it has developed 
resource management expenditure accounts (ReM EA), for which up to now no data have been 
collected. For the sake of completeness, the table covers also ETEA, a dataset with no linkages to 
COFOG, sourcing its inform ation from the National Tax List and ESA table 9, i.e., another data 
collection  within government finance statistics.
