governmental units in the determination of the health expenditure. COFOG functions (purposes) and 
SHA functions are also different in respect of the contents and level of aggregation.  
The comparison of the two systems presented in the tables can onl y be interpreted as a reference 
overview of the possibilities of using COFOG in the construction of SHA -HC and the possible links 
between SHA functions and the purpose classification of COFOG. They have been derived from the 
SHA-2011 Annex A Relationship o f the ICHA to Other Classifications , with particular references to

with specific sets of activities performed in relation to health care.
