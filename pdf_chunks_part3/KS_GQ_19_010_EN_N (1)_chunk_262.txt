, however, be noted that transactions related to the 
resource management (RM) can be assigned to a number of COFOG divisions and groups, which 
have overa ll a broader coverage, i.e., they include apart from RM -related transactions also non -
environmental activities and expenditure.  
As presented in table 8, RM expenditure of S.13 is broadly classified within COFOG divisions 04 
'economic affairs ' and 06 'housing and community amenities ', together with other non -environmental 
expenditure. In this context, it should be noted that the on -going review of the classification of 
environmental activities aims at better clarifying definitions and scope of specific RM a ctivities, which, 
in turn, might lead to a need to reconsider their linkages with COFOG categories .
