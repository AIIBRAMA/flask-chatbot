COFOG exp enditure data are measured for the general government sector in national accounts (with 
a breakdown in subsector s of government as appropriate). GERD data are reported along the 
‘sectors of R&D performance’44. GERD for the government sector (i.e. the govern ment's own R&D 
activities) is reported separately from the GERD for the higher education sector, whereas in national 
accounts , public universities are usually classified in the general government sector. GBARD data 
are considerably closer in coverage to CO FOG, since they consider all expenditure of government, 
whether on its own activities or transfers to other bodies. GBARD data for some countries do not 
include local government expenditure. Government  units acting at the state or local level may have 
only small amounts of expenditure on R&D (except for public universities , when classified into the 
local government subsector ).
