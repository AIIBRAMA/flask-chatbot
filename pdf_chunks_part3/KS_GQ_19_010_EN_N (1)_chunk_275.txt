 SHA -2011 classification headings, related to the health care ex penditure by 
function (ICHA -HC) looking at health care from the consumers side, in order to determine a 
correspondence with COFOG groups and classes related to health expenditure.  
When using the data created for SHA health expenditure by function, based on  the ICHA -HC 
classification, for cross -checking the data collected according to COFOG, the differences into the 
expenditure on health care in SHA need to be taken into account. There is not a single unique one -
to-one relation for any of the items.
