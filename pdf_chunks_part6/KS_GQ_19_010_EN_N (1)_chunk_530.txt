outlays). COFOG has three levels of detail: Divisions, Groups, and Classes. The divisions could be 
seen as the broad objectives of government, while the groups and classes detail the means by which 
these broad objectives are achieved.  
The initials “CS” or “IS” follow the title of each class in parentheses to indicate whether the services 
produced by general government units and included in this class are collective or individual services, and 
thus whether individual and collective final consumption expenditure should be recorded in respective 
functions. This is in line with provisions in ESA 2010 para. 3.104-3.107. 
The description of the COFOG classification as published by the UNSD is reproduced in this appendix. To 
this description, COFOG TF has added comments on the ESA transaction to be used.
