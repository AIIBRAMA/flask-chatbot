l municipalities, county authorities, joint parish councils, 
and a large number of other local government units through the Municipa lity State Reporting System: 
www.ssb.no/en/offentlig -sektor/kostra.  These accounts all have a classification of expenditure  
according to both type and function. There are approximately 150 functi ons in the local government 
chart of accounts, each one representing an activity or purpose of government. The functions are 
converted into COFOG using a bridge table.  
Non-market corporations and self -governing  institutions do not report data according to a functional 
classification. Each unit is therefore linked to an appropriate  COFOG function.
