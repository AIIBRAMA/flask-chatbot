ment, most expenditure  is classified by the supplier according to the type of service 
provided. These generally fit well with the COFOG categories.  
Areas that are difficult to assign are Net non -life insurance premia (D .71) and health expenditure . 
Net non -life insurance premia  (D.71) is an imputed transaction and derived from insurance surveys. 
Currently, the COFOG split of D .71 is derived by proxy from other COFOG current expenditure data.  
Currently the UK Department of Health is unable to provide a breakdown of their expendit ure which 
fits into COFOG categories. Therefore, all expenditure for the Department of Health which is not 
broken down by COFOG is assumed by the Office for National Statistics to relate to hospital services 
(COFOG 07.3).
