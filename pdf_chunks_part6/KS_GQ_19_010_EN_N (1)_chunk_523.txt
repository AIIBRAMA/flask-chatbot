ance Administration (FFA) collects data from public units based on national 
accounting standards (coded by nature and function). The FFA uses bridge tables to map the 
national classi fication to ESA 2010 and COFOG . These bridge tabl es were developed jointly by  FFA 
and SFSO.  
The financial statistics data is recorded, processed and evaluated in accordance with national (FS 
model) and the international (GFS model  and ESA model ) standard s. The FS model is based on the 
Harmonised Accounting Model of 2008 for the Cantons and Municipalities (HAM2).  
The HAM2 takes account of internati onal standards (e.g. COFOG as implemented by Eurostat, IMF 
and OECD), a s well as Switzerlandâ€™s specific federal circu mstances. The previous classification of 
task areas, based on the 1981 handbook on accounting for government units (HAM1) , deviated only 
slightly .
