Concerning sales of land (NP.1), there are methodological differences between diff erent subsectors . 
For central government, sales of land is allocated to COFOG by looking at the selling entity and at 
the budget item against which the sale is booked. For local governments there is a  problem with data 
availability. COFOG 01.33 is used for  county councils. For municipalities there is a lack of information 
regarding sales of land and the COFOG allocation is assumed to be the same as  the allocation of 
purchased land, for which there is data, in a given year.
