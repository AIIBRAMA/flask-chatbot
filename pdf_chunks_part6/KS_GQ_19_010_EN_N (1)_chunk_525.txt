5.32.7.  Consumption of fixed capital exp enditure  
In the past method 6 has been used, where the consumption of fixed capital ( P.51c) is assigned to 
the functions of each subsector by applying the structur e of P.51g.  
Consumption of fixed capital (P.51c) for two categories of fixed assets were dire ctly assigned to a 
function (P.51c for military weapon systems (COFOG 02.1) and P.51c for R&D (COFOG 01.4)). The 
remaining share of P.51c was allocated in a first estimate  to other general services (01.33).  
Within the scope of the next revision, Switzerlan d plans to use more in depth information from the 
source  data to achieve a more detailed and precise allocation of the P .51c to each function.
