 classification and compilation 
methodology  
Source data classification are not according to COFOG.  Therefore, Statistics Netherlands translates 
administrative functio nal informa tion to COFOG functions based o n the most detailed available 
source data.  
For the State, which is the main entity of central government, individual b udget lines are assigned to 
COFOG functions and economic categories by Statistics Netherlands.  
The municipalities, provinces, local governmental institutions and  water boards provide a matrix of 
administrative functions and economic categories which is translated to ESA classifications. For 
some economic categories, such as gross fixed capital format ion, administrative functional 
classification is at a very high level. Statistics Netherlands has to make additional  estimates to split 
this data.   
For social security funds, very detailed information on social benefits is available for social protection 
schemes which can be related to COFOG. Ope
