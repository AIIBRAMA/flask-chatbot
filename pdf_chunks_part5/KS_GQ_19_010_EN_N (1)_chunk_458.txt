units are collected and aggregated by the Ministry of Finance. Budgetary Reporting is bas ed on 
budgetary classification of revenues and expenditure . This classification consists of three levels: 
titles, chapters and paragraphs. The names of titles, chapters and paragraphs enable us to decide 
between which units the transactions take place.  Data collected are on cash basis. However, the 
transition algorithms from cash data to accrual and from budgetary classification to COFOG have 
been elaborated so that it can be used as a source for functional data.  
The budgetary classification is available si nce 2001 and it is amended every year.  
Extra budgetary units , that is budgetary establishments, auxiliary units, special funds and 
appropriated funds , also use the budgetary classification.  
The expenditure  of units not included in Budgetary Reporting are c lassified according to their main 
activity.
