nected with all COFOG divisions. To estimate expenditure for all

the Field of Science and Technology Classification and by the Nomenclature for the Analysis and 
Comparison of Scientific Programmes and Budgets  are considered . For all reported research the 
COFOG codes are assigned. As a second step in the estimation process the information on turnover 
from research for eac h unit is determin ed and compared with the total turnover for the whole unit and 
relevant share s calculated. The share determined for the assigned COFOG code is  then applied to 
all ESA exp enditure categories f
