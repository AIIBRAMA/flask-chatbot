 
The coding used in the table is described in section 5.1.2.  
5.17.6.  Individual and collective final consumptio n 
expenditure  
The allocations are made using functional classifications in line with ESA 2010 para . 3.104 -3.106. 
5.17.7.  Consumption of fixed capital expenditure  
The capital stock is calculated by sector and branches (extended NACE classification) by using the 
Perpetual Inventory Method  (PIM) . So, for the estimation of c onsumption of fixed capital ( P.51c), the 
preferred method 2 is used: the PIM is applied by subsector and NACE, and then bridged with 
COFOG.  
As gross fixed capital formation on own account R&D is cal culated before the Perpetual Inventory 
Model is applied, P.51c on own account R&D is allocated to th e division that it belongs to. F or 
example, according to a survey where a university’s main activities in R&D are in basic research, the 
P.51c of the univer sity’s R&D will be allocated to COFOG divi sion 1, general public servi ces.
