5.20.3.  Revisions policy  
The publication of COFOG data follows from the regular Government Finance Statistics (GFS) 
revision policy. Generally the first provisional annual COFOG estimates for year t-1 and final 
estimates  for year t-2 are published  in the summer. We also have the possibility for a yearly revision 
of the COFOG structure for the whole time series, as long as it does not change GFS and NA figures 
in other tables. The figures are fully aligned with the GFS and National Accounts (NA), exce pt for a 
small difference in the breakdown of consumption into individual and collective components in the 
provisional estimate . 
Every five years Statistics Netherlands conducts a  benchmark revision of GFS and NA. In that case, 
the whole time series is sub ject to revision. The latest benchmark revision was published in 20 18.
