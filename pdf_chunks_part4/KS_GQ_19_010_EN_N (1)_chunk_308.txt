 need not g ive the same results for expenditure on those functions as in the COFOG 
breakdown. Satellite accounts will generally give higher results because they count all of the 
expenditure on the activity using a detailed breakdown, whereas in the COFOG classificati on the 
main activity is considered under the main purpose while the auxiliary activities are classified under 
the specific purposes.  
COFOG data can differ from satellite accounts data related to the same topic because COFOG 
provides a classification of tot al government expenditure, and needs to reach a full consistency 
among the 10 divisions and their breakdowns. On the other hand, satellite accounts, using ad hoc  
classifications, provide specific focus on a single theme of expenditure and do not generally need to
