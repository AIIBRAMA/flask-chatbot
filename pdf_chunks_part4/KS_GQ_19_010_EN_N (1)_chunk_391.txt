between the two classifications, t he link between programmes and COFOG 
groups was established using percentages. A joint Istat - Ministry of the Economy task force 
produced a bridge table between COFOG and the programmes with the aim of fulfilling the 
accounting law requirements and providing the national accounts with COFOG classification s. 
Although this new classification was implemen ted very early  for the main central government body 
(‘the State’) , it has only been adopted at a local level from 2016. As a consequence, inclusion in 
national account s compilation practices may lead to an improvement in COFOG data at the next 
benchmark re vision planned for  2019.
