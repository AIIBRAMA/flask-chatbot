Eurostat consolidation rules for D.41, D.7 and D.9 (D.92) are applied to the data. Thus, at the  general 
government level these aggregat es will only include transfers to other institutional sectors, whereas, 
at the subsector level the same aggregates will include transfers to other general gov ernment 
subsectors. The estimation  of the transfers betwee n subsectors by COFOG is complex and time 
consuming and requires a wider dataset than the consolidated data.   
Further improvements in the quality of the statistics, namely a more accurate second level

local government bodies. The standardisation of data sources for local government units should  help
