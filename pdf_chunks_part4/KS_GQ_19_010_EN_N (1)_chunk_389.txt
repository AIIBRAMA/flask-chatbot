main activity which usually  relate s to a single function.  For research bodies , expenditure is allocated 
to COFOG using a brid ge matrix between the NABS nomenclature (used for the research 
expenditure classification and adopted by the OECD Fr ascati Manual) and COFOG.  In general, 
expenditur e transactions are split among  the different functions concerned.  
The COFOG classification h as yet to be adopted in local government units’ budgets, so bridge 
matrices are used to convert data from the public accounts’ functional classification to COFOG. 
Whenever a bridge matrix is used the correspondence is established at the third COFOG level; 
however, this  does not exclude that further investigations and revisions in the COFOG codes are 
sometimes required. At the local government level the basic functional classification of expenditure is 
generally quite precise, except within the regions, wher e
