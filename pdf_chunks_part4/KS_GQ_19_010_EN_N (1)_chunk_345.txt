The nomenclature of the social security funds is different from the nomenclatures of other general 
government units described above, except for the Federal Employment Agency which has the same 
classification for the economic kind of  receipts and expenditure  as the central government. They use 
classifications called “Kontenpläne” (table of accounts) which are adapted to their specific tasks. 
Unlike the other nomenclatures, within these classifications an expenditure or revenue item is  only 
allocated to one dimension. These tables of accounts are sufficiently detailed that an expenditure 
item can directly be assigned to a certain COFOG group.
