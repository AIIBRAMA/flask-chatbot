ditional social contributions.  
On the other hand, ESSPROS distinguishes between expenditure for social benefits and expenditure 
for administrati on of social benefits. In COFOG, the costs of administration of government benefits 
are included in social transfers in kind  (D.631) . 
Another difference between ESSPROS and national accounts should be underlined: COFOG is a 
classification of expenditure by  function made from the government point of view, whereas 
ESSPROS classification by function is related to the kind of social protection event, whose 
corresponding payment is made for relieving the beneficiary from the burden of that risk or need. As 
such,  the ESSPROS represents a guide for the functional classification of government expenditure 
connected with social risks and events , as it allows to establish a link between the paying institutions 
and the beneficiariesâ€™ point of view.
