 public accounting  (named "classification fonctionne lle"). For social security funds , the 
classification is made by units but some specific corrections are made by INSEE for benefits (social 
transfers in kind or benefits in cash) , in order to split into  health and social protection functions , or to 
allocate  at the second level within health or social protection .  
Concerning t ransfers , when they are not assigned  to a specific function they are classified under 
“transfers of a general character between different levels of government” (01.8) . This results in a 
slight bias compared with what would be the case if such transfers were broken down by the function 
of the expenditure of the recipient.  
Classification at source is not available for years before 2000. For years 1995 to 1999, estimates 
were made based on t he 1995 source data. Data for the years before 1995 are not available.
