 units. Therefore , a 
functional  code is assigned to the whole unit, resulting in the expenditu re receiving the same function  
code. In some instances, the smallest identifia ble bodies in the national accounts may carry out  more 
than one function. In these  case s it may be possible to divide the expenditure of multi -function bodies 
between functions using various data relating to their expenditure. When this is not possible , all the 
expenditure of the multi -function unit is assigned to the function corresponding to the major portion of 
the expenditure.
