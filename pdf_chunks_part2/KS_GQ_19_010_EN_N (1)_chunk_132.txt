rage time -series of the gross fixed capital formation by function is representative of the underlying 
stock of fixed assets. Furthermore, where there is no possibility of differentiating by  subsector , there 
might be an incorrect representation of P.51c  as the distribution of fixed assets at the level of 
subsector  can be rather different, depending on the functions of each subsector . 
Method 4 : estimations based on time -series of gross fixed c apital formation (P.51g) by function for 
each subsector  of general government. P.51c  by function is then calculated by applying the average 
structure of gross fixed capital formation by function on total P.51c  of subsector s. This method 
assumes that the av erage time -series of the gross fixed capital formation by function is 
representative of the underlying stock of fixed assets.  
Method 5 : estimations based on gross fixed capital formation (P.51g) by function in a given year for 
the total of  general governme nt. P.51c  by
