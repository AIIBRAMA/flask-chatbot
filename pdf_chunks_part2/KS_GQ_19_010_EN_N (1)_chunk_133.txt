function is then calculated by applying the structure of 
gross fixed capital formation by  function on total P.51c . This method assumes that the gross fixed 
capital formation by function of a given year is representative. It must be adopted wit h caution, 
verifying the existence of specific investment in some functions in the reference year to avoid 
distortions in the resulting distribution of P.51c  by function.  
Method 6 : estimations based on gross fixed capital formation (P.51g) by function in a given year for 
each subsector  of general government. P.51c  by function is then calculated by applying the structure 
of gross fixed capital formation by function on total P.51c  of subsector s. This method assumes that 
the gross fixed capital formation by f unction of a given year is representative. It must be adopted with 
caution, verifying the existence of specific investment in some functions in the reference year to 
avoid distortions in the resulting distribution of P.51c  b
