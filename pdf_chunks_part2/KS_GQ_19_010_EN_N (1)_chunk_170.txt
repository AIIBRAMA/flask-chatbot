ial benefits in kind are usually services provided directly by government employees 
or paid for by government; in this latter case they are considered as social transfers in  kind - 
purchased via market producers (D.632). The functional classification depends on the type of 
assistance provided. If it is to assist in daily tasks, not needed to be provided by nurses or other 
trained health care staff (non -medical assistance), th en old age  (10.20) should be used. Whenever 
health services are provided at home, the classification should be paramedical services  (07.24), i.e. 
health services delivered in patients' homes . Other case would be nursing and convalescent home 
services  (07.3 4), i.e. if those are in -patient services.  
NB: In case when the same staff provides both services (under 07.24 and 07.34), one should 
allocate  amounts between the two.
