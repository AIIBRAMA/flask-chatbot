s one of the components of 
householdsâ€™ actual consumption expenditure ( ESA 2010 , para graphs  3.100 -3.107) and its calculation 
is required  to provide  a measure of th at part of go ods and services that households consume but do 
not pay for.  
In practice, Eurostat acknowledges vintage differences between ESA table 11 and ESA table 2. 
Some countries choose to update ESA table 2 when compiling COFOG, while others choose to 
update ESA ta ble 2 at the next regular revision opportunity.  
In any case, the split between P.31 and P.32 should not be constrained to the preliminary split 
obtained for compilation of ESA table 2 and other tables, but rather vintages differences should be 
tolerated a nd if possible, aligned.
