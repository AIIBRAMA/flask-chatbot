 cases, persistent differences with either ESA table 2 and 25 or between ESA 
table 2/ 25 and tables 1 / 8 (for more countries) etc. do occur.  
Such persistent differences, which are not eliminated at the next opportunity to revise data, are an 
indication of a restrictive revision policy coupled with a biased indicator (such as being based on 
NACE) used in other tables.  
It can be observ ed that the split between individual and collective consumption is straightforward 
when the COFOG functional classification is used as the reference for classifying the public 
expenditure. It is particularly  importan t to use COFOG to classify the transacti ons entering the GDP 
calculation; in this way government production and government final consumption expenditure will be

collective final consumption exp enditure.  
Furthermore, as government individual final consumption expenditure i
