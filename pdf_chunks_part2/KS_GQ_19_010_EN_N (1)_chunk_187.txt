and commercial affairs  (04.1) , as this COFOG group includes 'formulation  
and implementation of general economic and commercial policies, grants, loans or subsidies to promote  
general economic and commercial policies and programs, supervision  of the banking industry '. The 
classification  under 'economic affairs n.e.c. ' (04.9)  should be avoided as payments to banks have 
their own classification.  
Bank  resolutions are also to be re corded in COFOG group 04.1.  
A similar guidance applies for the classification of guarantee fees, in as far as they are recorded as 
payments for non -market production (P.131, thus affecting final consumption expenditure) and not as 
a tax (D.29).  
Any expend iture of deposit insurance guarantee funds should be allocated to COFOG class 04.11 
general economic and commercial affairs. This includes the 'regulation or support of general 
economic and commercial activities, [â€¦], supervision of the banking industry'.
