pose . For example, a 
government -supported programme to improve health by encouraging participat ion in sport activities 
serves the functions of both health (07) and recreation (08). For the COFOG breakdown of total 
government expenditure it is important  not to  double count th is expenditure so as to ensure 
consisten cy with the total in Table  0200 . In cases where there are no physical indicators  available to 
split the total expenditure between the different functions, only one function â€” the main function, 
should  be used. In classifying such cases, if the main function is not clear, the nature of the 
government unit making the payments can give a good indication of the main function ; for example, 
in the previous case, is the expenditure being  made by the  ministry of health or the ministry of sport. 
When s maller units are  involved guidance can also be taken by comparing the ir functions and 
activities with those of the financing or the controlling units.
