 argued that managing public debt is closely associated with 
managing public deposits. As regards practical reasons, the inclusion of FISIM on deposits enables a 
cross-country comparison between countries where the COFOG allocation of expenditure is made 
before the intermediated consumption related FISIM on deposits is allocated, and between countries 
using P.2 including total FISIM allocation.  
It could be argued from  a conceptual point of view that direct service charges in managing 
government debt (ESA 2010 para. 3.68 -3.73) should be treated in the same manner as FISIM on 
loans. For countries where the holding of assets and management of debt is highly centralised, t his 
could be a good conceptual option. However, in many cases, lack of detailed data is likely to prevent 
such an allocation and was not considered practical.
