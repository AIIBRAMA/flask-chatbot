ory rather than their aggregations (e.g. P.51g - gross fixed capital formation – rather 
than OP5ANP - gross capital formation + acquisitions less disposals of non -financial non -produced 
assets).  
In some cases additional economic categories , not separately requested in the table 1100 
compilation, are examined , such as P .52 + P.53  - changes in inventories and acquisitio ns less 
disposals of valuables , as they c an either be implicitly observed or impact economic categories 
supplied in table 1100. 
OP5ANP–gross capital formation + acquisitions less disposals of non -financial non -produced assets:  
 P.51g – gross fixed capital formation can be connected to all COFOG divisions. However , 
no amounts of P.51g should be observed in COFOG groups 01.7 and 01.8. Only small or 
one-off amounts are expected in groups where government performs only regulatory 
functions (e.g. 04.1).  
 P.52 + P.53  – inventories are mainly expected in d ivision 02 defence, group  04.2
