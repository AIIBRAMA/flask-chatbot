Companies can submi t proposals for R&D grants to a government agency, receiving a wage subsidy 
when certain criteria are met. The company can use the results of the R&D activity to develop new 
technologies and applications/products.  
In cases where the R&D subsidies play a s ignificant role in business results, a suitable classification 
of transfers to the corporati ons sector would be COFOG group  04.8, which also r eflect s the 
government contribution to R&D expenditure of the total economy. On the other hand, wage 
subsidies may  also be allocated to the other COFOG groups 04.1/ 04.2/ 04.3/ 04.4/ 04.5/ 04.6/ 04.7/ 
04.9 (non -R&D economic functions) depending on the industry the company is located in, if these 
subsidies are only partially linked with R&D and their amount does not si gnificantly affect the 
companyâ€™s results.
