hod 1 : detailed  perpetual inventory method (PIM) for the total of general government sector, 
which involves maintaining fixed assets and bra nches. This information is then bridged with functions 
(COFOG).  
Method 2 : detailed perpetual inventory method (PIM) for each subsector  of general government

Method 3 : estimations based on time  series of gross fixed capital formation (P.51g) by f unction for 
the total of general government. P.51c  by function is then calculated by applying the average 
structure of gross fixed capital for mation by function on total P.51c . This method assumes that the
