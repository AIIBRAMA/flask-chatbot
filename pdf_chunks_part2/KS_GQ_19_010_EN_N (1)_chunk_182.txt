es (07.3) 
It is sometime s difficult to classify health services between the outpatient services and the hospital 
services, especially given the increasing frequency of day -hospitalisation. To allow for a correct 
classification , the difference between day case s - considered as hos pital services  - and outpatients'  
services is recalled.  
Day case: a day case is a patient who makes a planned attendance at hospital and requires the use 
of a bed or trolley in lieu of a bed. The patient is not expected to (and does not) remain overnight,  but 
does otherwise have the same characteristics as an inpatient. Day cases would therefore be 
classified to COFOG 07.3 hospital services.  
Outpatient: all visitors to ambulatory care facilities that are not day cases , overnight cases  or 
inpatients, are co nsidered outpatients and have to be classified under COFOG 07.2  outpatient 
services .
