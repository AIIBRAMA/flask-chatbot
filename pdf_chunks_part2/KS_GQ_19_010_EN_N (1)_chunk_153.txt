structures of expenditure 
from previous years or using trend analysis. This practice will mostly be a partia l one, such as for 
subsector s or specific entities  — mostly local government — where data sources are lacking . One 
important aspect is that the structure by function of the previous year(s) should be applied separately 
to each of the transactions that form  the ESA 2010  expenditure of year n -1. When applying the 
COFOG structure of previous year(s), a correction could be made for any noticeable events in the 
year which have a significant impact on a given COFOG category. This information could be derived, 
for example, from the EDP Questionnaire and the related attachments.  
For most countries, the best practice related to the lack of data sources for provisional year n -1 
would be other public accounts’ data sources, which are already available for that year, s uch as 
expenditure broken down by budgetary chapters/ departments, or data in budgetary expenditure
