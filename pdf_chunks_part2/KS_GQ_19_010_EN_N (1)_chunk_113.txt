In collective groups, both should be strongly correlated with the amount of P.3 observed, but 
less so in division  04, where con sumption of fixed capital is likely to have a higher share in 
P.1 and thus P.3.  
In COFOG group  01.7 only P.2 related to FISIM should be recorded. No amounts for D.1

in group  01.7, P.2 should be equal to P.3) .  
D.1 amounts in other groups excluding administrative expenditu re should be smal
