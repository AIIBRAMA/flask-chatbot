 excluded from the estimation of own account production of R&D for non -
market producers. At the same time the TF considered that P.51c on own -account R&D needed to 
be recorded and that  the sum of cost approach for measuring the output of non -market producers 
should be applied. That is, P.51c should be recorded on R&D assets and this P.51c should feed fully 
into the production costs used for the measurement of non -market output. The TF c onsidered that 
P.51c on R&D should enter the production costs of "other production" rather than own account 
production costs of R&D. The TF further considered that "the way in which this recommendation [..] 
should be elaborated should be taken forward by G FS experts." The recommendation on the P.51c 
of own -account R&D avoids overstating general government output (P.1), gross fixed capital 
formation (P.51g), total revenue and total expenditure.  
Given the TF report, the 15th meeting of the COFOG TF in June 2 019 concluded that final
