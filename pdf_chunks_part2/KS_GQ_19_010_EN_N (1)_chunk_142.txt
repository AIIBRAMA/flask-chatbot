 government), sector accounts, etc. The split between P.31 and P.32 naturally determines  
actual final consumption (P.4) of general governments and households. In practice, it may also affect 
total final consumption expenditure of general government in previous years' prices given the 
underlying practical assumptions.  
A key difficulty for many  Member States is the timing of the availability  of COFOG data sources and 
compilation (by t+12 months after the reference year) versus the timing of key tables of the ESA 
2010 transmission programme (e.g. table 0102 by t+2 months after the reference year) . 
Therefore, in practice, for national accounts main aggregates, often other methods and indicators are 
used to split P.31 and P.32.  Insofar as these are unbiased, and other national accounts data could 
be revised following the compilation of COFOG level I I P.3, vintage differences for recent periods but 
no persistent systematic differences should occur.  
In practice, in isolated
