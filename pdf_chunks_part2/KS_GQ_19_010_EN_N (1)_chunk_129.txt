rpetual inventory 
method (PIM) should be applied to each subsector  of general government. This involves maintaining 
a complete dataset of fixed assets and branches by kind of economic activity. This data should then 
be bri dged to information on functions (COFOG). This is Method 2 as described below; it is the 
preferred method as it allows allocating consumption of fixed capital by function by following the 
corresponding distribution of fixed asset s. 
Methods  5 and 6 should b e avoided  as far as possible . These methods broadly correspond to the 
use of estimates based on gross fixed capital formation (P.51 g) by function in a given year 
respectively for the total of general government or for each of the subsector s. 
3.3.2.  Background  
Consumption of fixed capital ( P.51c ) is one of the components of final consumption expenditure 
(P.3), which is one of the memo randum  items requiring a COFOG breakdown in ESA 2010  
transmission table 1100.
