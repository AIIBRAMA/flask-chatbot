Manual on COFOG s tatistics  3.10.40.  Case 40 - imputed social contributions for 
military and police personnel due to shorter careers  
Guidance:  Military  defence  (02.1), Police services (03.1) 
In several countries, the social contribution rate for military and police staff is higher than the rate for 
other civil servants. This is due to their shorter career as service  personnel  generally retire earlie r. 
Activities related to defence and public order and safety are generally more exposed to safety risks 
than other civil servants and often give rise to the right to an earlier retirement. As a result, this leads 
to higher levels of D.1 for COFOG 02 and CO FOG 03. It can be observed that this issue is not 
specifically a matter of COFOG classification being relevant, but rather to reflect economic balance in 
the pension system for civil servants.
