 as the computation is not based on the 
depreciation allowed for tax purposes. P.51c  is not reported in COFOG, however, as P.51c  is a 
component of output of general government and thus of final consumption expenditure, it is 
necessary to distribute P.51c  and thus fixed assets by  COFOG.  
Net operati ng surplus  (B.2n)  
Net operating surplus (B.2n) is calculated  on market output (P.11). While the majority of output of 
government is either provided 'for free' or sold at not economically significant prices, market output 
can exist as 'i ncidental sales' or as output by market establishments that cannot be considered as 
quasi -corporations (see ESA 2010 para. 20.43 and 20.107). For such market output  of market local

can lead to occurrences of negative final consumption expenditure. Net oper ating surplus is only 
calculated on market output, implying that the difference between
