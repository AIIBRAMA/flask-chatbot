only negative values routinely expected in COFOG transmissions would be: P.5/ P.51g, NP and 
therefore OP5ANP and possibly TE (and in some countries D.8).  
For this reason, all negative values occurring in other transact ions are routinely pointed out and 
correction and/ or clarification is requested.  
Comparison with ESA table 2 / 25: 
ESA table 11 should be consistent with ESA tables 2 and 25.  
However, a s described in chapter 2.1.3, the transmission deadlines for ESA tabl e 2 and 11 differ 
from each other.  
This may lead to the occurrence of vintage differences.  
1) Either new data sources could become available between the compulsory transmission of ESA 
table 2 at end -September and the compilation of ESA table 11 at end -Dece mber , or  
2) The compilation final consumption expenditure (P.3) according to COFOG may lead to differences 
in the breakdown between P.31 (individual) and P.32 (collective) supplied previously in ESA table 2.  
In the former case, table 25 should
